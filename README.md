This is a simple react application that can keep track of your income and expenses. 
It will also help to visualize your daily expenses.
Every new transaction detail is stored and the changes reflect dynamically without loading the page. A pie-chart is also being incorporated into the layout to help the user visualize his spending on each category. This is a single page application. At no point the page reloads to fetch new or updated data.
React Hooks and context API is being used in this project
